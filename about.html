        <p>
            I want to learn multiple aspects of MIS including web development, cyber
            security, Information security, and computer systems analysis.
            I feel my work and volunteer experience so far has helped me develop an
            understanding of teamwork and the responsibility that comes with accountability.
            I anticipate opportunities using data and logic which allows teams to capitalize on
            trends that organizations may not see.
            I strive to be an excellent communicator, inquisitive and to become the best
            version of myself to help others. I always try to hold myself to a higher standard
            than others hold for me.
